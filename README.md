# Readme Generator

A CLI app to automatically generate a readme markdown file.

## User Story

<p>
Given a base framework from which to generate a readme file, the requirement was to use the inquirer npm to prompt the user for questions, then use the user's answers to create a readme file.
The file was to contain a section for each of the user/s answers as well as a Table of Contents.
